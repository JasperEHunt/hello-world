# hello-world

I am completely new to GitHub!

Hopefully I'll be doing things on this site before too long.

Things I accomplished in this tutorial:
* Created an open source repository
* Started and managed a new branch
* Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
* Opened and merged a Pull Request
